  <p>
    Madhya Pradesh is a state in central India. Its capital is Bhopal, and the largest city is Indore, with Jabalpur, Ujjain, Gwalior, Sagar, Satna, Narmadapuram, Shahdol, Rewa and Morena being the other major cities.
    Madhya Pradesh is the second largest Indian state by area and the fifth largest state by population with over 72 million residents.
    Madhya Pradesh is the “Tiger State of India”. Madhya Pradesh has three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Bhimbetka, Sanchi and Khajuraho. 
    Pench National Park inspired Rudyard Kipling's 'The Jungle Book' and the real Mowgli was found in Jungle of Seoni. 
    Snooker was invented at Jabalpur.
    The city of Ujjain arose as a major centre in the region, during the second wave of Indian urbanisation in the sixth century BCE. 
    It has served as the capital of the Avanti kingdom. 
    Other kingdoms mentioned in ancient epics – Malava, Karusha, Dasarna and Nishada – have also been identified with parts of Madhya Pradesh.
    Ujjain emerged as the predominant commercial centre of western India from the first century CE, located on the trade routes between the Ganges plain and India's Arabian Sea ports.
    The Satavahana dynasty of the northern Deccan and the Saka dynasty of the Western Satraps fought for the control of Madhya Pradesh during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE.
    Chandragupta Maurya conquered northern India around 320 BCE, establishing the Mauryan Empire, which included all of modern-day Madhya Pradesh. Ashoka the greatest of Mauryan rulers, conquered it, bringing the region under firmer control. 
    After the decline of the Maurya empire, the region was contested among the Sakas, the Kushanas, the Satavahanas, and several local dynasties during the 1st to 3rd centuries CE. 
    Heliodorus, the Greek Ambassador to the court of the Shunga King Bhagabhadra erected the Heliodorus pillar near Vidisha.
